# Pharmacy System â€” OOP Project

**Course:** CSIS215
**Language:** Java

---

##  Whatâ€™s This Project About?

This is a simple **Pharmacy System** built in Java as part of my Object-Oriented Programming course. The system helps manage medicines in a pharmacy â€” adding new ones, updating info, and keeping everything organized.

Itâ€™s a menu-based program that uses **Object-Oriented Programming concepts** like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to make the system clean and easy to expand.

## How It Works

The project uses a **main file** that shows a menu for the user and connects to different classes that handle medicines. There are three main types of files:

1. **OOP_Project.java** â€” This is where the program starts. It shows a menu to the user and calls functions from other classes.

2. **Medicine.java** â€” This is the main blueprint for any medicine. It includes:

   * Name, composition, dose, price, quantity
   * Getters and setters to read or change info
   * Methods to display medicine details and compare medicines

3. **OverTheCounter.java** â€” For medicines you can buy without a prescription.

4. **Prescription.java** â€” For medicines that need a prescription.
